# Plant-leaf-dieases-detection-using-CNN
This project implements an image-based classification system to detect plant leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. It uses a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify leaf images into four categories: healthy and three types of diseases.
